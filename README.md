# Cyclistic-Rider-Analysis
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders prefer to  traditional bike and  about 8% of riders use the assistives options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work.

This project aims to find out how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual  members.
